# 16S-MicrocoleusDB
Benthic cyanobacterial blooms, often linked to anatoxin-a and congeners (ATX) production, are increasingly documented in rivers and lakes, with *Microcoleus* (Oscillatoriales) blooms reported frequently.

This repository provides an updated *Microcoleus* 16S rRNA sequence database with 104 near-complete sequences from reported genomes (details in the (detailed in the [16SDb_description](https://github.com/Cecilio8422/16S-MicrocoleusDB/blob/225fbff55a98df842350cbe16e43ba2bbe55c74c/16SDb_description.xlsx) file). The sequences are available in FASTA format ([Microcoleus_16Sseq](https://github.com/Cecilio8422/16S-MicrocoleusDB/blob/225fbff55a98df842350cbe16e43ba2bbe55c74c/Microcoleus_16Sseq.fasta)), with taxonomy provided in a CSV file ([Microcoleus_16Stax](https://github.com/Cecilio8422/16S-MicrocoleusDB/blob/225fbff55a98df842350cbe16e43ba2bbe55c74c/Microcoleus_16Stax.csv)). Species clusters were defined using a 95% Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) threshold.

Additional resources include a *Microcoleus*-curated Silva database compatible with QIIME2 for microbial community profiling, and the *Microcoleus-classifier* tool for identifying *Microcoleus* 16S sequences via global alignment methods.

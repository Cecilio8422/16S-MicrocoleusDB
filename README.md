# 16S-MicrocoleusDB
Benthic cyanobacterial blooms, often linked to anatoxin-a and congeners (ATX) production, are increasingly documented in rivers and lakes, with *Microcoleus* (Oscillatoriales) blooms reported frequently.

High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing is a key tool for profiling microbial communities from mat DNA, offering insights into taxonomy and ecology. Accurate identification of *Microcoleus* blooms depends on the use of the most up-to-date databases for precise taxonomic resolution.

This repository provides updated 16S rRNA sequences for *Microcoleus*, which can be used for phylogenetic analysis and microbial community profiling. It enables the identification of specific clades associated with anatoxin production in mats dominated by this genus.

## 16S-MicrocoleusDB Description
This database contains 104 near-complete 16S rRNA sequences recovered from *Microcoleus* genomes previously reported (detailed in the [description](https://github.com/Cecilio8422/16S-MicrocoleusDB/blob/225fbff55a98df842350cbe16e43ba2bbe55c74c/16SDb_description.xlsx) file). The file Microcoleus_16Sseq.fasta contains the sequences in FASTA format, and Microcoleus_16Stax.csv provides the taxonomy for each sequence. Species clusters were defined based on genome clustering at 95% Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI).

This database contains 104 near-complete 16S sequences recovered from Microcoleus genomes previusly reported (described in the 16SDb_description file). File Microcoleus_16Sseq.fasta contains the sequences in fasta format and file Microcoleus_16Stax.csv contains the taxonomy of each sequence. Species clusters were defined by the clustering of genomes at 95% of Average Nucleotide identity.

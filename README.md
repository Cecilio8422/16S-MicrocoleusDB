# 16S-MicrocoleusDB
Benthic cyanobacterial blooms, often linked to anatoxin-a (ATX) production, are increasingly documented in rivers and lakes, with *Microcoleus* (Oscillatoriales) blooms reported frequently.

High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing is a key tool for profiling microbial communities from mat DNA, offering insights into taxonomy and ecology. Accurate identification of *Microcoleus* blooms depends on the use of the most up-to-date databases for precise taxonomic resolution.

This repository provides updated 16S rRNA sequences for *Microcoleus*, which can be used for phylogenetic analysis and microbial community profiling. It enables the identification of specific clades associated with anatoxin production in mats dominated by this genus.

## 16S-Microcoleus description
This database contains 104 near-complete 16S sequences recovered from Microcoleus genomes reported
